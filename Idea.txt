üìë Project Proposal: Anki Extension for Automated IndiaBix Flashcard Generation
1. Project Overview
IndiaBix provides a huge repository of logical reasoning, aptitude, and general knowledge questions, widely used by students preparing for competitive exams. However, manual conversion of these questions into flashcards for long-term retention is time-consuming.
 This project proposes an Anki extension that allows users to directly import Q‚ÄìA pairs from IndiaBix into their Anki decks by simply pasting the URL of a section.

2. Problem Statement
Current preparation methods involve repetitive browsing of IndiaBix and manual note-taking, which is inefficient for spaced repetition. There is no direct integration between IndiaBix‚Äôs structured content and modern learning tools like Anki.

3. Objectives
Develop an Anki add-on (extension) to scrape questions directly from IndiaBix section links.


Parse content into MCQ-style flashcards (Question + Options on front, Answer + Explanation on back).


Automatically tag flashcards with relevant topics (Reasoning, GK, etc.).


Allow users to choose categories and deck names before importing.


Ensure seamless integration with Anki desktop and sync with AnkiMobile/AnkiWeb.



4. Key Concepts
Anki Add-on Development (Python, PyQt).


Web Scraping & Parsing (BeautifulSoup, Requests).


Deck Generation (Anki‚Äôs API, AnkiConnect, or add-on hooks).


Spaced Repetition for learning efficiency.



5. System Design / Workflow
User Input ‚Üí Paste an IndiaBix section link (e.g., Basic GK, Blood Relations, etc.) in the extension.


Scraper Engine ‚Üí Fetch questions, options, answers, explanations.


Data Formatter ‚Üí Convert into MCQ card structure.


Front: Question + Options


Back: Correct Answer + Explanation


Deck Builder ‚Üí Automatically create/import deck in Anki.


Flashcard Sync ‚Üí Cards are available across Anki desktop & mobile.



6. Expected Outcomes
Anki users get instant flashcards from IndiaBix without external tools.


Faster revision cycle for aptitude & GK preparation.


A reusable, open-source extension that can be extended to other Q‚ÄìA sites.



7. Future Scope
Extend support to other learning platforms (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, etc.).


Add daily deck updates (scrape ‚ÄúQuestion of the Day‚Äù automatically).


Provide quiz/game mode inside Anki for better engagement.


Integrate AI explanations where IndiaBix lacks clarity.
